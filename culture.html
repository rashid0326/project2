	<p>Malaysia is located in Southeastern Asia which is close to Thailand, Indonesia, & Singapore.</p>
	<p>Malaysia uses an alphabet language such as ABC and our second language is English so it is not that hard to speak over there :).</p>
	<p>In Malaysia, the government actually ruled by a King and Queen for a long time.</p>
	<p>With the constitutional changes, the rules do have a King and Queen but are governed by a Prime Minister.</p>
